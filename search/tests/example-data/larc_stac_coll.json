  "description": "MOP02N_7 is the Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT) Level 2 Derived CO (Near and Thermal Infrared Radiances) (MOP02N) Version 7 data product. It consists of the geolocated, retrieved carbon monoxide profiles and total column amounts for carbon monoxide. Ancillary data concerning surface properties and cloud conditions at the locations of the retrieved parameters are also included. Each retrieval is accompanied by an estimated error.Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT) was successfully launched into sun-synchronous polar orbit aboard Terra, NASA's first Earth Observing System spacecraft on December 18, 1999. The MOPITT instrument was constructed by a consortium of Canadian companies and funded by the Space Science Division of the Canadian Space Agency.",
